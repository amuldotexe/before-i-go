You might not believe this

but someone was happy that you were born

one of the most soothing writings I've read was from this surgeon Paul Kalanithi

this blog inspired me to write this repository

because I realized life can be so fragile

this was his message to his 1 year old daughter:
That message is simple: When you come to one of the many moments in life when you must give an account of yourself, provide a ledger of what you have been, and done, and meant to the world, do not, I pray, discount that you filled a dying manâ€™s days with a sated joy, a joy unknown to me in all my prior years, a joy that does not hunger for more and more, but rests, satisfied. In this time, right now, that is an enormous thing.
